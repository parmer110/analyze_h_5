## Notes
Hi there.
I have going start a Django project which handling a web page request simulation and getting response which is an excel file.
next prepare copy and paste some of downloaded excel file to another specific excel destination sheets after a few manipulation on initial downloaded data filtration, then finalize the target excel file preparation with some manipulation same sorting data, extending or running pivot table. next taking copy some range of each sheets on clipboard and paste on specific telegram application target or in a web social media application field.
Please guide me about defining this project engineering architecture.
Now I have started a Django project and declared a Postgresql database about.
Please guide me about overall study and structure, applications creation and all recommendations.
