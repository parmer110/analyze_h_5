## Project Overview
This project is designed to handle web page request simulations and generate responses in the form of Excel files. It processes the downloaded Excel files, performs data manipulation, and integrates with Telegram and other social media platforms to share the processed data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/parmer110/analyze_h_5.git
   cd m10

## How to Run the Project

1. **Start the Django development server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver

#### Dependencies
List the main dependencies required for the project.

## Dependencies

- Django
- pandas
- openpyxl
- telethon
- psycopg2-binary

## Description
A brief description of what your project does.

## Usage
### Authentication
Authentication
Login and Store Token:

The LoginViewSetHamkadeh handles user login and stores the authentication token in the session.
Example:
class LoginViewSetHamkadeh(viewsets.ViewSet):
    def create(self, request):
        # Your existing login logic here
        token = response.data.get('token')
        if token:
            request.session['token'] = token
        return Response(response.data)
Retrieve Token in Another View:

You can retrieve the stored token in another class-based view (CBV) using request.session.get('token').
Example:
class AnotherViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
    def some_method(self, request):
        token = request.session.get('token')
        # Use the token for further processing

## Notes
Hi there.
I have going start a Django project which handling a web page request simulation and getting response which is an excel file.
next prepare copy and paste some of downloaded excel file to another specific excel destination sheets after a few manipulation on initial downloaded data filtration, then finalize the target excel file preparation with some manipulation same sorting data, extending or running pivot table. next taking copy some range of each sheets on clipboard and paste on specific telegram application target or in a web social media application field.
Please guide me about defining this project engineering architecture.
Now I have started a Django project and declared a Postgresql database about.
Please guide me about overall study and structure, applications creation and all recommendations.

# Project Structure
1. ## Django Project Setup
- Create a new Django project.
- Set up your PostgreSQL database in settings.py.

2. ## Applications
- **Web Request Handling:** An app to handle web requests and responses.
- **Excel Processing:** An app to manage downloading, manipulating, and saving Excel files.
- **Data Manipulation:** An app for sorting data, running pivot tables, etc.
- **Integration:** An app to handle integration with Telegram and other social media platforms.

# Steps
1. ## Web Request Handling
- Create views to handle incoming requests.
- Use Django's HttpResponse to return Excel files.

2. ## Excel Processing
- Use libraries like pandas and openpyxl for Excel file manipulation.
- Create functions to filter and manipulate data.

3. ## Data Manipulation
- Implement sorting and pivot table functionalities.
- Ensure data integrity and validation.

4. ## Integration
- Use libraries like telethon for Telegram integration.
- Automate copying data to social media platforms.

# Recommendations
- **Modular Design:** Keep each functionality in separate apps for better maintainability.
- **Documentation:** Document your code and processes thoroughly.
- **Testing:** Write tests for each functionality to ensure reliability.

## Project Setup

### Windows Version
- **Dependencies:**
  - `pywin32`: Provides access to the Excel COM interface for full Excel functionality.
  - Install with: `pip install pywin32`
- **Setup:**
  - Ensure Excel is installed on the server.
  - Configure Django settings for Windows.

### Linux Version
- **Dependencies:**
  - `openpyxl`: For reading/writing Excel files.
  - `pandas`: For efficient data manipulation.
  - Install with: `pip install openpyxl pandas`
- **Setup:**
  - Ensure all necessary libraries are installed.
  - Configure Django settings for Linux.

### General Notes
- Maintain separate branches for Windows and Linux versions.
- Regularly merge changes from the main branch to keep both versions up-to-date.
